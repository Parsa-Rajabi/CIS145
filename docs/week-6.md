  - [How to connect to CIS Web Server/video instructions](resources.md#video-instructio)

Make sure you're in a place with a good computer and steady internet when taking the quiz. If your computer or internet stops working during the quiz, it is up to you to get back online and finish before the time's up. 

Before the quiz:
Update your computer so it doesn't start updating in the middle of your quiz.
Try out your internet before and a few hours before the quiz. If you're using Wi-Fi, think about plugging into the internet with a cable.
Make sure other devices aren't using up all the internet while you're on the quiz.
It's a good idea to have a backup plan, like another computer or different internet, just in case. You may also be able to use the computers located on campus (if you're nearby).

Quiz Tips:
I recommend submitting your quiz every hour just to make sure you know how to complete the process and everything is taken care of. Not making a submission will result in a mark of 0.
As mentioned before, neither Navneet or I will be answering any questions related to the exam. Do your best with your best interpretation (and note them down in your answers, if needed). 

Open-book Quiz Rules
You must complete the test BY YOURSELF (no friends, no tutors, no classmates, no humans - cats and dogs in the room are fine).
Any form of communication with other humans, terrestrial or extraterrestrial is not allowed 
(Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Terminal, Signal, iMessage, SMS, MMS, etcâ€¦)
The test is open-book, open-notes, open-IDE (e.g. VSCode) EXCEPT websites and plugins that help you cheat such as ChatGPT, BingAI, Chegg, Course Hero, Slader and other similar websites that have tutors answering questions you upload 
W3Schools, Khan Academy or freeCodeCamp are permissible as long as they are explicitly cited/references in the code using HTML/CSS comments
Copying the question text and googling IS CHEATING
Posting the question text and asking someone to solve it for you IS CHEATING
Using google to search for concepts is NOT cheating (however using any AI-based search engine i.e. BingAI IS CHEATING).
If you come across the same or similar question on google, resist the temptation to keep reading, and close your browser tab.
Do NOT share quiz questions with anyone - that IS CHEATING
Overall, do not stress! You will be fine.
