## Page Layout
- Wireframe is a sketch or diagram of a web page that shows the structure (but not the detailed design or content) of the basic page elements.
- Wireframes are used in the design process 
  - to experiment with various page layouts 
  - to develop site structure and navigation


A website is often divided into headers, menus, content, and a footer.
A Website Layout is usually one (or a combination) of the following:
1-column (often used for mobile browsers)
2-column (often used for tablets and laptops)
3-column layout (only used for desktops)
The following example shows one way to create a two column layout

## Fixed layout (solid layout or static layout)
It does not change with the size of the browser
Has fixed width and may hug left margin (unbalanced look)
Can be centered (more appealing)

## Fluid layout (liquid layout)
The content flows to fill whatever size the browser is
Content configured with percentage values for width
Can be centered

## Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design makes your web page look good on all devices.
Uses relative units and media queries, combining liquid and adaptive layout
As browser width increases/decreases, layout will flex (liquid layout)
If browser goes beyond certain width (from media query), then the layout changes to accommodate a wide or narrow width
