# Labs

Labs are intended as exercise for you to learn new concepts and get hands on experience to practice the course material. We will be using **Khan Academy** as the platform to complete them.

## Details 

Labs will be assigned via Kha Academy on a regular basis (~weekly). Check your email from Khan Academy for specific items that need to be completed. Some of these items include videos, readings, hands-on activities and knowledge checks. In order to recieve a "completion checkmark", videos need to be watched in full (from beginning to end), .

## Submission Process

Below are submissions instructions for all labs in this course:

1. Labs should be completed via Khan Academy's website and a screenshot of all completed work should be submitted to Blackboard
2. The screenshot of completed work should include:
   1. **Your completed lab:** Make sure ALL assigned components of the lab are clearly visiable (you may take multiple screenshots if they do not fit) and have a checkmark or say "completed", indicating that they're completed.
   2. **A note/word file with your identification information:**
      1. Lab #
      2. Your Full Name
      3. Your Student ID
      4. Current Date/Time (this must match your system's date/time)

**Important:** Screenshot submissions without a note that includes the information above will recieve a 50% mark deduction. Failure to submit a screenshot to Blackboard will result in a mark of zero. No exceptions.

### Example Screenshot

Here is an example of how your screenshot(s) should look like. Make sure to include the all information required in the note and include the computer's date/time in the screenshot.
