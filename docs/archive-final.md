  - [How to connect to CIS Web Server/video instruction](resources.md)

> [!ATTENTION]
> Make sure you're in a place with a good computer and steady internet when taking the exam. If your computer or internet stops working during the exam, it is up to you to get back online and finish before the time's up. 

## Before the exam:
- Update your computer so it doesn't start updating in the middle of your exam.
- Try out your internet before and a few hours before the exam. If you're using Wi-Fi, think about plugging into the internet with a cable.
- Make sure other devices aren't using up all the internet while you're on the exam.

> [!ATTENTION]
> It's a good idea to have a backup plan, like another computer or different internet, just in case. You may also be able to use the computers located on campus (if you're nearby).

## Exam Details:
- There will be NO Zoom during the exam. The exam will be considered as a take-home exam.
- I recommend submitting your exam every hour just to make sure you know how to complete the process and everything is taken care of. Not making a submission on Blackboard will result in a mark of 0.
- As mentioned before, neither Navneet or I will be answering any questions related to the exam. Do your best with your best interpretation (and note them down in your answers, if needed). 

## Exam Rules
- You must complete the test BY YOURSELF (no friends, no tutors, no classmates, no humans - cats and dogs in the room are fine).
- Any form of communication with other humans, terrestrial or extraterrestrial is not allowed (Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Terminal, Signal, iMessage, SMS, MMS, etc…)
- The test is open-book, open-notes, open-IDE (e.g. VSCode) EXCEPT websites and plugins that help you cheat such as ChatGPT, BingAI, Chegg, Course Hero, Slader and other similar websites that have tutors answering questions you upload 
> [!TIP]
> W3Schools, Khan Academy or freeCodeCamp are permissible as long as they are explicitly cited/references in the code using HTML/CSS comments
- Copying the question text and googling **IS CHEATING**
- Posting the question text and asking someone to solve it for you **IS CHEATING**
- Using google to search for concepts is NOT cheating (however using any AI-based search engine i.e. BingAI **IS CHEATING**).
- If you come across the same or similar question on google, resist the temptation to keep reading, and close your browser tab.
- Do NOT share exam questions with anyone: that **IS CHEATING**
- Overall, do not stress! You will be fine.

## Submission Process

The submission process for the exam includes 2 parts:
1. Upload your files/folders to CIS Web Server
2. Submit your exam on Blackboard

### General Overview
- Validation your HTML files, save them as PDF in a folder called Reports

  - If there are issues with the code, resolve them. 
  - Save your validation reports as a PDF 
    - [Click here to get instructions on how to create a PDF from a page](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/save-as-pdf-instructions/)
  - Create a new folder called Reports and place both reports in the folder
  - Name the reports as the following:
    - `FileName_HTML_Validation.pdf`
- Upload your file to CIS Web Server
  - [Connect to the CIS Web Server using instructions given in class/course website](resources.md)
  - Create a folder called Q0
  - Place both HTML files in the folder
  - Copy the link to your folder on the CIS Web server
    - It should look something like this: https://cisweb.ufv.ca/~rajabip/Q0 (instead of rajabip, it will be your student ID: 30123456)
    - Save the link as you will be submitting it to Blackboard as a comment
- Create a zip of your files (including your validation reports) and submit on Blackboard before the due date
  - [How to zip a file on Mac/Windows](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Zip-File)
  - The name of your zip file should be formatted as the following

> [!TIP]
> Make sure to also upload your Images folder to the CIS Web Server as your images will not be visible in the HTML file if they are not uploaded to the server. This will result in a loss of marks. 

## Academic Integrity

Academic Integrity is important to me and I know it is to most students. Cheating is never worth the risk to your personal and professional reputation. I expect students to be truthful and honest in their work. This means that any work you submit for individual evaluation should be yours alone and that you recognize the work of others if you use their ideas, thoughts or material. The assignments have been designed to ensure that you learn the material. I ensure that all students are graded fairly and will take action against students who violate the academic dishonesty policy. Students who engage in any acts of falsification, misrepresentation, or deception will face penalties for violating UFV policy, which can include failure in the assignment and/or a FD-Failed for Discipline grade on your transcript. Listed below are some examples of academic dishonest behavior that will result in a grade penalty:

### Plagiarism

This refers to passing off the work of another as your own. Make sure to cite all your sources if you incorporate the words or ideas of another person. This includes sources from books, journals, the internet, emails, live presentations (e.g. speeches) and even relevant conversations with other people. You can avoid plagiarism by appropriate citation and referencing in your papers, projects and presentations.

### Inappropriate use of technology in coursework

The use of technology to produce content for your assignments/quizzes that is not specifically listed in the syllabus as permissible is strictly prohibited. All submissions for grading must be your own work. This specifically includes a prohibition on artificial intelligence writing software such as ChatGPT and translation software as it will interfere with the learning objectives outlined for this course.

### Collusion/ Unauthorized Collaboration

You are expected to complete all assignments for this course on your own. When assigned individual work, it is unfair to collaborate and gain an unfair advantage over your classmates who complete their work on their own. Collusion includes sharing homework, quiz or test questions and answers with other students. Examples of collusion:

- Working on answers with a friend for a homework assignment or during an open book exam
- Using “tutoring websites” (e.g. Chegg.com, CourseHero) to find answers to assignment/ exam questions
- Assisting others to cheat by answering questions that are posted to a FB/ WhatsApp group
- Falsifying / fabricating information

Do not misrepresent yourself or your work. The following are examples of prohibited behavior:

- Making up sources or facts
- Misrepresenting your identity by asking someone else to complete any portion of a course (i.e. make comment on a discussion board, i-clicker quiz, exam)
- Falsifying or altering any documentation required by the University, including (but not limited to) doctors note’s in order to gain an academic advantage
 
### Unauthorized use of note-sharing websites

You may come across websites that claim to help students by providing answers to test questions and encourage students to upload your instructor’s copyrighted material (e.g. lecture slides, exam questions, etc.) Sharing exam/assignment questions is strictly prohibited as this material is the intellectual property of the instructor and should not be shared in any format. Furthermore, beware of uploading your own completed assignments/essays as you could be assisting other students to cheat using your material. Assisting others to cheat is strictly prohibited in the UFV student academic integrity policy.

Note sharing sites expect their users to comply with the Honour Code of their organization. Their own policy mandates that they cooperate with an investigation of academic dishonesty. The UFV Academic Integrity Office routinely monitors these sites for evidence of cheating and will initiate discipline proceedings against students who violate the UFV Student Academic Integrity policy.

### Unauthorized use of tutors/ editors

If you plan to use a tutor/editor, be aware that any work that you submit must always be your own. An ethical tutor will always focus on explaining concepts so that you can become an independent learner. You are violating the student academic integrity policy if:

- A private tutoring company coaches you on how to complete an assignment
- You buy / sell/  swap assignment questions and answers on social media platforms like WeChat, Whatsapp, Facebook, etc.
- Your use an editor (paid or unpaid) without permission of the instructor to revise, correct or alter your work
