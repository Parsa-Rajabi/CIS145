# Final Exam Practice

When preparing for your final exam in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it’s important to focus on the unique aspects of these subjects. Unlike other courses, web development offers immediate feedback. As you code, you can instantly see the results in your browser, which helps you quickly understand what works and what doesn’t. This hands-on learning approach is key—rather than just studying theory, **you’ll benefit most from actually building real projects, such as websites or interactive pages.  **

Here are some resources for you to explore in preparation for the final exam:

## Frontend Mentor

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) is a great resource for practicing your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. The site offers a variety of (free and paid) projects for you to work on, ranging from simple landing pages to more complex web applications. Each project comes with a design file (although you can ignore this if you prefer) and a set of requirements that you need to implement.

Since this is an introductory course, you should focus on the easier projects first with tag "Newbie". Once you feel comfortable with those, you can move on to the more advanced projects with the tag "Junior". 

You may need to sign up for a free [Github](https://www.github.com) account to access the projects.

## Dev Challenges

[Dev Challenges](https://devchallenges.io) is another great resource for practicing your frontend skills. Similar to Frontend Mentor, Dev Challenges offers a variety of projects for you to work on. Each project comes with a design file and a set of requirements that you need to implement. You can also sign up for a free account to access the projects.

## FreeCodeCamp

Although we used FreeCodeCamp as part of our assignments, you can continue to use it to practice your skills. The site offers a variety of coding challenges and projects that you can work on. You can also earn certifications by completing the required projects, which can be a great addition to your resume/CV.

## Friends & Family Websites

Another great way to practice your skills is to build websites for friends and family. You can offer to build a simple website for a friend’s business or a family member’s hobby. This will give you real-world experience and help you build a portfolio of work that you can show to potential employers.

## Need more practice?

If you need more resources, I recommend reviewing the assigned readings and youtube videos from the course. You can also check youtube for tutorials on specific topics you’re struggling with.
