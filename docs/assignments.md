# Assignments

Course assignments are intended to be a practical application of the course material and a hands-on guide for your learning. We will be using **freeCodeCamp** as the platform to complete them. The freeCodeCamp curriculum is a series of challenges and assignments that you can complete to earn certifications in various programming languages and technologies

**IMPORTANT: Some topics will be covered in class and some will be self-taught.** Although most topics will be covered in class, the order of the assignments may not align with the course schedule. We will do our best to align the assignments with the course material, however, some assignments may require you to learn new topics on your own until the class covers the topic later in the term

## Submission Process

Below are submissions instructions for all assignments in this course:

1. Assignments should be completed via freeCodeCamp's website and a screenshot of all completed work should be submitted to D2L Brightspace
2. The screenshot of completed work should include:
   1. **Your completed assignment:** Make sure ALL assigned components of the assignment are clearly visible (you may take multiple screenshots if they do not fit) and have a checkmark or say "completed", indicating that they're completed.
   2. **A note/word file with your identification information:**
      1. Assignment Name
      2. Your Full Name
      3. Your Student ID
      4. Current Date/Time (this must match your system's date/time)

> [!WARNING]
> Screenshot submissions without a note that includes the information above will receive a 50% mark deduction. Failure to submit a screenshot to D2L Brightspace will result in a mark of zero. No exceptions. Phone pictures will NOT be accepted and will result in a mark of zero.
